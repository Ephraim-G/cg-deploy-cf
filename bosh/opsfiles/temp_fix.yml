# The whole purpose of this file is to be used to temp merge in certain aspects to the deployment - mainly to rollback or forward certain options until cf-deployment catches up

# No longer needed with cf-deployment 21.9.0 moving CAPI to 1.136.0
## Rolling back CAPI from v1.134.0 to v.1.133.0 due to cpu/memory leak - see https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/issues/262
